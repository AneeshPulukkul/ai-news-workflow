## 4. Component Interactions

### 4.1 Scraping Engine and Database

The scraping engine interacts with the database through the following interface:

```python
class NewsDatabase:
    def save_article(article_data: Dict[str, Any]) -> bool:
        """Saves an article to the database, returns success status"""
        
    def get_recent_articles(category: Optional[str] = None, days: int = 7) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
        """Retrieves recent articles with optional category filter"""
```

Key interactions:
1. The NewsAggregator collects articles from multiple sources
2. Each article is passed to the database via save_article()
3. The content generator retrieves articles via get_recent_articles()

### 4.2 Content Generator and AI Service

The content generator interacts with OpenAI via LangChain:

```python
class ContentGenerator:
    def generate_article(source_articles: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Generates an article based on source articles"""
        
    def generate_social_post(article: Dict[str, Any], platform: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Generates a social media post for a given platform"""
```

Key interactions:
1. The content generator selects relevant articles from the news database
2. LangChain chains are used to process articles and create prompts
3. OpenAI API is called with the constructed prompts
4. Responses are processed and stored in the content database

### 4.3 Review Interface and Content Database

The review interface interacts with the content database through API endpoints:

```
GET /api/content/pending - Retrieve pending content
POST /api/content/articles/{id}/approve - Approve an article
POST /api/content/articles/{id}/reject - Reject an article
POST /api/content/articles/{id}/edit - Edit an article
```

Key interactions:
1. The web interface loads pending content for review
2. User actions trigger API endpoints for approval/rejection/editing
3. The API layer updates the content database accordingly
4. Status changes are reflected in the user interface

## 5. Data Models

### 5.1 News Article Schema

```python
{
    'id': int,  # Primary key
    'title': str,  # Article title
    'content': str,  # Full article content
    'url': str,  # Original article URL (unique)
    'source': str,  # Source name (e.g., "TechCrunch")
    'category': str,  # Category (e.g., "technology", "leadership")
    'published_date': str,  # Original publication date
    'scraped_date': str,  # When the article was scraped
    'keywords': List[str],  # Extracted keywords (stored as JSON)
    'summary': str  # Article summary
}
```

### 5.2 Generated Content Schema

```python
{
    'id': int,  # Primary key
    'title': str,  # Generated article title
    'content': str,  # Generated article content
    'category': str,  # Content category
    'source_articles': List[int],  # IDs of source articles (stored as JSON)
    'generated_date': str,  # Generation timestamp
    'status': str,  # Status (pending, approved, rejected)
    'feedback': str,  # User feedback if rejected
    'edited_content': str,  # User-edited version (if any)
    'type': str  # Content type (article, twitter_post, linkedin_post)
}
```

## 6. Error Handling Strategy

The system implements a multi-layered error handling strategy:

### 6.1 Component-Level Error Handling

Each component implements try-except blocks to catch and handle specific exceptions:

```python
try:
    # Component-specific operation
    result = perform_operation()
except SpecificException as e:
    # Log the error
    logger.error(f"Operation failed: {e}")
    # Implement fallback or recovery mechanism
    result = fallback_operation()
```

### 6.2 System-Level Error Recovery

The main workflow coordinator implements error recovery mechanisms:

1. **Retry Logic**: Failed operations are retried with exponential backoff
2. **Circuit Breakers**: Prevent cascading failures by stopping operations after multiple failures
3. **Graceful Degradation**: System continues with partial functionality when components fail

### 6.3 Logging and Monitoring

Comprehensive logging is implemented across all components:

1. **Structured Logging**: JSON-formatted logs with consistent fields
2. **Log Levels**: Different severity levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
3. **Contextual Information**: Logs include relevant context for troubleshooting
